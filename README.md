# GAP-IDE

Contains the GAP IDE implementation and installer. Using electron to build 
cross-platform executables, this IDE runs in all main OS Win, Unix and MAC.

This project is the base for the GAP package FIDM, based on XGAP, to provide
a cross-platform graphical interaction environment for GAP with a built in
Integrated Development Environment with Syntax Highlighting, Autocompletion, 
Linter, etc.

# How it Works 

For development NodeJS/NPM and Electron are required to build and run the tool.

bash$ npm start
```
